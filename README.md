# Creating EKS Cluster from Terraform Code - 

Use the Terraform Folder from the repository which includes all AWS EKS code required for terraform to provision an EKS cluster. (The Files have been taken from https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws, you can also use other examples which suits best for your use case.)
</br > 

Note - The instance will require AWS Cli as it requires to give permission to provision AWS services or else the terraform will provide an output with an error. 

```
terraform init

terraform fmt
